# Mobile Application Development: Exercise 3

## Overview

This Flutter project, named "Exercise 3," is designed to serve as a mobile application that includes a login screen. The login screen allows users to input their username or email and password for authentication. Additionally, it provides options for users to recover their forgotten credentials and offers alternative login methods such as Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.

## Project Structure

The project is structured with the following key components:

- **main.dart**: This is the entry point of the Flutter application. It initializes and runs the `MyApp` widget, which sets up the application's theme and defines the home page.

- **home_page.dart**: The `HomePage` widget represents the main login screen of the application. It includes UI elements for user input fields (username/email and password), a login button, a "Forgot Password?" option, and alternative login methods (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Pinterest). The page layout is customizable, and it is built using Flutter's Material design components.

- **pubspec.yaml**: This file contains project metadata, dependencies, and assets configurations. It specifies the project's name, description, version, and required Flutter SDK version. It also lists dependencies such as `cupertino_icons` and `font_awesome_flutter`. Asset files, such as images, are defined in the `assets` section.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- `flutter`: The core Flutter framework.
- `cupertino_icons`: Provides Cupertino-style icons for iOS.
- `font_awesome_flutter`: Allows the use of FontAwesome icons for enhanced UI design.
